THE FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM
The food delivery system has come to put an end to the stress of going to restaurants to get the food of your choice but one could rather get doorstep delivery. This was design to define the customer platform where they can create orders from the list of available restaurants selling their desired cuisines and search for the meals they want. It also provide a platform where restaurants can upload, accept orders and then add the price of the item uploaded for customers view also; there will be a user login page to that connects the restaurants and customers. 

SCOPE
Based on the limited time given to complete this project, I will be designing the user platform where they can register as a user also; customers can view the list of menu-items from different restaurants. On the other hand, the restaurant owner will be able to upload their products, edit, view and delete.

USERS/CUSTOMERS
Customers can make orders, but before ordering, user’s needs to register on the platform before gaining access as a user using the registration options like email and password or phone numbers and password.

RESTAURANT
On this application, the vendor’s owner will be able to ADD/EDIT/UPDATE/DELETE. This will show the list of restaurants and their items using sections and menu. Likewise, restaurant owners can view the booking orders.

ADMIN
•         The admin can handle all customers and restaurants owners.
•         The admin can ADD/EDIT/UPDATE/DELETE restaurant records and user records.
•         They can manage food categories, manage payment and can track order records.
 
APP NAVIGATION
1: Every new user you can view the restaurant product and chect the available meals.
2: The ability for every user to login and access what the restuarant has unfortunately users can not make order still working on creating different endpoints which will connect both the restaurant and delievery together.
3: For every user on this app, users are authenticated to access the home page, view and make order(not implemented yet).
4: A restaurant owner can create a restuarant, create a menu and menuitem, edit likewise he or she can add image url to both menu and menuitem. For every restaurant a login is required for them to access their restaurant.
5: For staff which is admin, they can create, edit, delete and also create a role for all other staff.
The superuser can assign permission to all users and admin too.
